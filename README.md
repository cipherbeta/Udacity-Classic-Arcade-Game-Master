## Game Features

  - Bugs (it's a feature!)
  - Incremental gameplay and ramping difficulty with procedurally generated enemies
  - Forced restart system on game over, alerting player of score and level.


## How to get 'er up and running
1. Clone repository or download .zip.
2. Extract .zip to directory of your choice if applicable
3. Open index.html in your web browser of choice (if you still use IE7, question your life choices)
4. Use the arrow keys to move your character. Avoid the bugs and make it to the water to progress to the next level.
5. Shoot for your high score! Or don't, I'm a readme, not the police.
